### **Project Description**

Blush & Josie is an e-commerce site I have made where users can buy hand-crafted earrings. The user will start on the home page where they will see a welcome post with images. From there they can scroll down to an image that takes them to a collections page where they can see a variety of different earrings with their name and price or hit the collections link on the navbar. On the collections page they can click on a product and it will send them to a show page where they can add that product to their cart or delete it from their cart.

### **User Stories:**
* User will be able to go to site and see a home page with a slide show or photo with a quick about me section explaining about the company. Below that will be a collections picture that links to the collections page. 

* The navbar will include an option to go to the back to the home page and the shopping cart.

* When the user clicks on a pair of earrings in the collections page, they will be redirected to the earring's show page and have the choice to add it to their cart and also delete it from their cart. 

* Whenever user clicks on the cart in the navbar the user will be redirected to the cart page and shown everything that has been added to their cart.

### **MVP:**
* Be able to look through different earrings on the collections page
* Be able to add earrings to cart from the show page
* Be able to delete earrings from cart

### **Stretch Goals:**
* Add user authentication
* Leave reviews on different earrings in the show page
